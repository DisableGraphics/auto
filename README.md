# auto
The definitive *NIX script to automate things

Never thought that it was boring to type "make" or "sh compile.sh"?
Well, the first option is less annoying to type, but I am presenting AUTO, an alternative to make.

# What is auto?
auto is a simple script for UNIX-like operating systems which helps making the project.
The only thing needed is a script named "auto" with the instructions in sh or whatever you use.
It needs no arguments, so you just have to type "auto" in the console. Could it be easier?
# Example auto
  g++ foo.c -o foo.o --> auto
  bla@bla:/home/bla/foo$ auto --> this will execute the auto script stored in that folder
# What does this bring?
For "makefilers" it brings a simpler interface to compile their projects. And, for
those who don't want to tinker with makefiles, it's an easier solution.

  Please, if you find an error in the readme, please tell me. English is not my main language, so I might make errors.
