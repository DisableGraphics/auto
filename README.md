# auto
The definitive *NIX script to automate things

Never thought that it was boring to type "make" or "sh compile.sh"?
Well, the first option is less annoying to type, but I am presenting AUTO, an alternative to make.

# What is auto?
auto is a simple script for UNIX-like operating systems which helps making the project.
The only thing needed is a script named "auto" with the instructions in sh or whatever you use
# Example auto
  g++ foo.c -o foo.o
# What does this bring?
For "makefilers" it brings a simpler interface to compile their projects. And, for
those who don't want to tinker with makefiles, it's an easier solution.
